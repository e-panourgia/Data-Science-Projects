## Assignment 3

In this Jupyter Notebook, we conduct an exploratory analysis of the [GSV-Cities dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amaralibey/gsv-cities), available on Kaggle. The objective is to apply unsupervised learning techniques—specifically clustering algorithms—to uncover meaningful patterns and segment cities based on visual and spatial features.
