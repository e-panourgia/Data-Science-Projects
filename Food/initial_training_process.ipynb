    "## Baselines\n",
    "- Benchmark analysis is crucial for evaluating classification performance in multiclass imbalance settings because it provides reference points for how well your model is performing relative to simple baseline classifiers. The `Random Classifier` and `Majority Classifier` are commonly used as benchmarks for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Classifier \n",
    "- A Random Classifier predicts class labels randomly, with **uniform** based on the distribution of classes. It sets a minimal baseline and helps understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Baseline Performance`: This represents the expected performance `without learning from the data`. `If a model performs worse than a random classifier, it indicates either issues in the model or unsuitable features`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Chance Levels`: It shows what performance you'd `get by chance alone`, especially useful for imbalanced datasets where metrics like accuracy can be misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Majority Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Majority Classifier always **predicts the majority class** (`the class with the highest frequency in the training data`). \n",
    "\n",
    "- It helps understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `Handling Imbalance`: In multiclass imbalanced datasets, accuracy can be dominated by the majority class. The majority classifier provides a baseline to compare how well your model captures minority classes.\n",
    "    - `Baseline of Naïve Solutions`: The majority classifier reflects the simplest possible rule for prediction. If a model's performance is close to that of a majority classifier, it suggests the model is failing to generalize or adapt to the minority classes.\n",
    "    - `Focus on Class Imbalance`: Metrics like weighted accuracy, balanced accuracy, or macro-F1 score should be significantly better than those achieved by the majority classifier to indicate that a model is addressing imbalance effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note in the following code cell I implement the code for Random and Majority Classifier, in order to have a high level of \"logic\" we added the split steps of trainingtest set, but for example for the Random Classifier it is useless as it is not affected from the input, dont learn from data.\n",
    "    - Hoever, this \"skeleton\" is useful for the reamaining algorythms to buils in (both traditional and advanced) \n",
    "\n",
    "- More specifically, \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Random Classifier  Effect of X: The X values (features) **do not influence the random classifier's predictions**. It does not learn from the data in the feature column. Its predictions are purely random, so changing X will not alter its performance.\n",
    "    - Majority Classifier Effect of X: The feature column X is ignored by the majority classifier, as it does not use features for prediction. Instead, it looks only at the distribution of y in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regarding the Implementation \n",
    "- The `DummyClassifier in scikit-learn` is a baseline model designed to evaluate classification algorithms by comparing them against simplistic strategies. These strategies provide minimal logic to make predictions and are often used as benchmarks to understand how well a more complex model performs.\n",
    "    - `strategy=\"uniform\"` (for Random Classifier): \n",
    "        - Predicts a class randomly and uniformly across all possible classes.\n",
    "        - Each class has an equal probability of being selected, irrespective of the class distribution in the training data.\n",
    "        - Use Case: Ideal for scenarios where you want to simulate random guessing.\n",
    "    - `strategy=\"most_frequent\"` (for Majoriry Classification)\n",
    "        - Always predicts the most frequent class observed in the training data.\n",
    "        - Ignores the input features entirely and focuses only on the training set's class distribution.\n",
    "        - Use Case: Useful for understanding how well a naive baseline would perform if you simply predicted the majority class."

    "- **a)** Adjusted hyperparameters to align with the nature of the problem (multi-class classification).  \n",
    "- **b)** Focused on manually adapting hyperparameters to improve the custom metric. This was our main goal during the benchmark adjustment of parameters.   \n",
    "- **c)** Some hyperparameters were adjusted to align with memory and time constraints. For instance, the max_features parameter in TF-IDF was fine-tuned. Additionally, in logistic regression, we opted for the multinomial approach instead of the One-vs-All classification strategy to optimize resource utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "While some degree of overfitting to specific classes is expected—particularly for classes with low support due to data imbalance—this trade-off is accepted duwe to teh nature of the  data having imbalance. This is evident in cases where significant differences between precision and recall are observed, especially in underrepresented classes.\n",

    "- Systematic hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search or Optuna).  \n",
    "- Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA to enhance performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy we followed in high level\n",
    "- For each algorythm we manually adapt the parameters of the model and tf-idf (being our preprocess vectorization step). These adaptation of parameters based on two main diamensions: \n",
    "  - `a)` We tailored each algorithm to align with the **nature of the problem**. For example, in Logistic Regression, we addressed the multiclass classification challenge by setting the parameter `multi_class='multinomial'`. Similarly, for XGBoost, we adapted it to the multiclass problem using the objective `multi:softmax` and specifying `eval_metric='mlogloss'` to evaluate performance effectively.\n",
    "  - `b)` We focused mostly on the custom score of the competition as the goal of the competition is to increase it. \n",
    "  - `c)` We further analyzed the average macro F1 scores (a key metric for the competition) alongside the individual per-class F1 scores derived from the classification reports. This deeper analysis aimed to identify specific classes where the model struggled with predictions. While valuable for understanding model performance, this detailed evaluation is less impactful at this stage, primarily due to class imbalance. Classes with low support tend to exhibit significant disparities between precision and recall. `However, in future work, this insight could be leveraged to regroup poorly predicted classes into a new category e.g. Other, potentially improving the custom competition score. And we could apply it only for the hazard classes as hazard affect more the competition score that the product ones.` Due to time constraints, our primary focus remained on the evaluation described in section b).\n",
    "  - `Preprocess Strategy Vectorization`: For tf-idf, to ensure comparability across the results of different algorithms, we maintained a consistent vectorization strategy. The only parameter we manually adjusted was max_features. However, we observed that varying this parameter, both for the title and text features, did not lead to an improvement in the competition score. the remaining parameters we used maintained constant (`(strip_accents='unicode', analyzer='char', ngram_range=(2, 5), max_df=0.5, min_df=5,`)\n",
    "    - **Note** : the adaptation of the parameter `max_feature` has more meaning for the `text` input, but in our case we did not observe improvement in the score of the competition. \n",
    "      - So, we simple re-run the same models via changing only the input that is \"title\" and \"text\" of the models.\n",
    "  - **Important Note**: Some parameters had to be adapted properlydue to time and memory limitations (e.g. OvA high complexity rejecte for practical reasons).\n",
    "- All benchmark analysis algorithms were primarily evaluated based on the competition evaluation score. This approach ensured a fairer comparison by aligning the evaluation criteria consistently across all methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why we  selected these algorythms in our benchmark analysis \n",
    "- The answer is because the these algorithms are great for benchmark analysis as **Logistic Regression models** `linear relationships`, **Random Forest** handles `nonlinear patterns through decision tree ensembles`, and **XGBoost** captures **complex** `nonlinear relationships using sequential, gradient-boosted trees for high predictive accuracy`.\n",
    "- In more depth:\n",
    "  - Key Difference Between Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost:\n",
    "    - `Logistic Regression` is a linear model for binary classification, offering simplicity and interpretability.\n",
    "    - `Random Forest` is an ensemble of decision trees, focusing on reducing overfitting and handling complex, nonlinear relationships.\n",
    "    - `XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)` is a gradient-boosting algorithm that builds trees sequentially, optimizing for speed and accuracy, and often outperforming Random Forest in predictive performance, especially on structured/tabular data.\n",
    "  - For future work, if Random Forest and XGBoost yield the best results, we could enhance performance further by combining them using a `stack ensemble technique`; however, due to time constraints, we were unable to explore or compare this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Initial Model Evaluation with \"Title\" Input\n",
    "- **Algorithms Tested**:\n",
    "  - `Logistic Regression`\n",
    "  - `Random Forest`\n",
    "  - `XGBoost`\n",
    "- **Parameter Setting**:\n",
    "  - Parameters for each algorithm are manually tuned based on preliminary analysis to balance performance and computational efficiency.\n",
    "- **Evaluation**:\n",
    "  - Models are assessed using:\n",
    "    - Standard evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).\n",
    "    - A custom evaluation metric provided by the competition.\n",
    "- **Objective**:\n",
    "  - Identify the most `promising algorithm` based on \"title\" input.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Evaluation with \"Text\" Input\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 4. Optimization of the Final Model\n",
    "- The chosen algorithm undergoes parameter optimization to refine its performance.\n",
    "- **Constraints**:\n",
    "  - Due to time limitations, cross-validation (e.g., K-fold validation) will applied one time (with K = 3) during hyperparameter tuning process bur for few hyperparameters combinations due to needed time needs.\n",
    "  - Instead, a streamlined validation approach is used to ensure efficient optimization without excessive computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Baseline Comparison\n",
    "- Throughout the process, model performance is benchmarked against baseline models:\n",
    "  - **Random Prediction**: A model that predicts randomly.\n",
    "  - **Majority Class Prediction**: A model that always predicts the most frequent class.\n",
    "- **Objective**:\n",
    "  - Provide context for evaluating the added value of the trained algorithms. We want our trained models both traditionals and advanced to outperforms the baseline models.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "This structured methodology ensures a thorough evaluation of multiple algorithms across different input types, with a focus on balancing computational efficiency and performance mostly of the competition. By the end of this process, the goal is to identify the best-performing algorithm with the best input title or text and optimize it for deployment within the constraints of time and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  General Comment for  Stratisfy \n",
    "- In comparison to the augmented runs, splitting training and test data is not feasible as some classes have only one instance. This may be handling with many ways (like oversampling methods, creating a category \"Other\" for teh minority classes etc.)\n",
    "- `In our case, we used `leave-one-out scenario for rare classes in your dataset.` \n",
    "  - Leave-One-Out: In this scenario, you \"leave out\" one instance of the rare class during training and use it as a test sample. This process is repeated for every instance of the rare class in the dataset, ensuring each example is used as the test case once.\n",
    "- Startisfy is crucial important for X-Boost.\n",
    "  - `XGBoost requires that all classes in the test set are present in the training data`.\n",
    "    - If it encounters a label during prediction that was not seen during training, it raises a `ValueError` because it cannot map the unseen label to its internal structure of classes.\n",
    "- In comparison with the other two models being Logistic Regression and Random Forests whrere they still work if they have not seen (unseen data) as intance of class. \n",
    "- As the three algorythms has diffrent internal way how they work internally.\n"

    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Set a random seed for reproducibility.\n",
    "   - Prepare dictionaries to store classifiers, vectorizers, and custom metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Label-Specific Training**:\n",

    "   - For each label:\n",
    "     - Perform a stratified train-test split to maintain class distribution.\n",
    "     - Use `TfidfVectorizer` to extract character-based n-gram features (2-5) with a maximum of 5000 features.\n",
    "     - Train a Random Forest classifier with 100 decision trees using the extracted TF-IDF features.\n",
    "     - Evaluate the model using F1 score and generate a classification report.\n",
    "     - Save the trained classifier, vectorizer, and test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Custom Metric Calculation**:\n",
    "   - Compute task-specific metrics for two subtasks:\n",
    "     - **Subtask 1**: Evaluate the relationship between `hazard-category` and `product-category`.\n",
    "     - **Subtask 2**: Evaluate the relationship between `hazard` and `product`.\n",
    "   - Combine F1 scores for hazards and products to compute the final metric for each subtask.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Logging and Output**:\n",
    "   - Print F1 scores for each label and custom metric scores for subtasks.\n",
    "   - Save classification reports to a dedicated directory.\n",
    "   - Return the trained classifiers, vectorizers, and custom metrics.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "- **`dataframe`**: Dataset containing features and target labels.\n",
    "- **`feature_column`**: The column in the dataframe to be used for feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- **`classifiers`**: A dictionary of trained XGBoost classifiers for each label, including label encoders.\n",

    "### Key Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Set a random seed for reproducibility.\n",
    "   - Prepare dictionaries to store classifiers, vectorizers, and custom metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Label-Specific Training**:\n",
    "   - Iterate over four labels:\n",
    "     - `hazard-category`,\n",
    "     - `product-category`,\n",
    "     - `hazard`,\n",
    "     - `product`.\n",
    "   - For each label:\n",
    "     - Perform a stratified train-test split to maintain class distribution.\n",
    "     - Use `TfidfVectorizer` to extract character-based n-gram features (2-5) with a maximum of 2000 features.\n",
    "     - Encode target labels into numeric values using `LabelEncoder`.\n",
    "     - Train an XGBoost classifier with the following parameters:\n",
    "       - Maximum depth of 6.\n",
    "       - 50 estimators.\n",
    "       - Learning rate of 0.2.\n",
    "     - Evaluate the model using F1 score and generate a classification report.\n",
    "     - Save the trained classifier, vectorizer, label encoder, and test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Custom Metric Calculation**:\n",
    "   - Compute task-specific metrics for two subtasks:\n",
    "     - **Subtask 1**: Evaluate the relationship between `hazard-category` and `product-category`.\n",
    "     - **Subtask 2**: Evaluate the relationship between `hazard` and `product`.\n",
    "   - Combine F1 scores for hazards and products to compute the final metric for each subtask.\n",
