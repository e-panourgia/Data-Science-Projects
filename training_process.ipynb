        "- Benchmark analysis is crucial for evaluating classification performance in multiclass imbalance settings because it provides reference points for how well your model is performing relative to simple baseline classifiers. The `Random Classifier` and `Majority Classifier` are commonly used as benchmarks for the following reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Random Classifier \n",
        "- A Random Classifier predicts class labels randomly, with **uniform** based on the distribution of classes. It sets a minimal baseline and helps understand:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `Baseline Performance`: This represents the expected performance `without learning from the data`. `If a model performs worse than a random classifier, it indicates either issues in the model or unsuitable features`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `Chance Levels`: It shows what performance you'd `get by chance alone`, especially useful for imbalanced datasets where metrics like accuracy can be misleading.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Majority Classifier\n",

        "- It helps understand:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - `Handling Imbalance`: In multiclass imbalanced datasets, accuracy can be dominated by the majority class. The majority classifier provides a baseline to compare how well your model captures minority classes.\n",
        "    - `Baseline of Naïve Solutions`: The majority classifier reflects the simplest possible rule for prediction. If a model's performance is close to that of a majority classifier, it suggests the model is failing to generalize or adapt to the minority classes.\n",
        "    - `Focus on Class Imbalance`: Metrics like weighted accuracy, balanced accuracy, or macro-F1 score should be significantly better than those achieved by the majority classifier to indicate that a model is addressing imbalance effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Note in the following code cell I implement the code for Random and Majority Classifier, in order to have a high level of \"logic\" we added the split steps of trainingtest set, but for example for the Random Classifier it is useless as it is not affected from the input, dont learn from data.\n",

        "    - Random Classifier  Effect of X: The X values (features) **do not influence the random classifier's predictions**. It does not learn from the data in the feature column. Its predictions are purely random, so changing X will not alter its performance.\n",
        "    - Majority Classifier Effect of X: The feature column X is ignored by the majority classifier, as it does not use features for prediction. Instead, it looks only at the distribution of y in the training data.\n",

        "### Regarding the Implementation \n",
        "- The `DummyClassifier in scikit-learn` is a baseline model designed to evaluate classification algorithms by comparing them against simplistic strategies. These strategies provide minimal logic to make predictions and are often used as benchmarks to understand how well a more complex model performs.\n",

        "Our approach involves `systematically evaluating three machine learning algorithms on two input types`, **\"title\"** and **\"text\"**. The goal is to identify the `b`est-performing model based on evaluation metrics and a custom competition evaluation metric`. Due to time and memory constraints, we set specific parameter values for each algorithm after initial manual investigation. This allows us to efficiently gain an overview of model performance and make informed decisions about **further optimization**.\n",

        "Notes for evaluation of `Logistic Regression` (input `title`): \n",
        "   - The Logistic Regression model outperforms both the majority and random classifier baselines, which is a positive outcome. \n",
        "        - If the model’s evaluation metrics were close to those of a random classifier, it would indicate that the training process was ineffective, as the model would essentially be making predictions at random. \n",
        "        - Similarly, if the model’s evaluation metrics were close to those of the majority classifier, it would suggest that the model requires further optimization, as it primarily predicts the most frequent class instead of learning meaningful patterns from the data. \n",
        "   - Analysis of Evaluation Report : \n",
        "   ### General Observations:\n",
        "   - **Overall Accuracy:** The model achieves an accuracy of **83%**, which is decent but insufficient as a standalone metric, especially for imbalanced datasets.\n",
        "   - **Macro Avg (F1 Score):** The macro average F1 score is **0.68**, highlighting significant performance variation across categories. This is much lower than the weighted F1 score of **0.82**, suggesting better performance on frequently occurring categories.\n",
        "   - **Weighted Avg (F1 Score):** The weighted F1 score is **0.82**, as it accounts for the class distribution, showing the model is biased toward the majority classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ### Class-wise Performance:\n",
        "   ### Strong Performers:\n",
        "   - **Allergens (F1: 0.87):** High precision (**0.82**) and recall (**0.93**), indicating consistent performance.\n",
        "   - **Biological (F1: 0.88):** Strong performance with balanced precision and recall.\n",
        "   - **Chemical (F1: 0.82):** Good overall performance.\n",
        "   - **Migration (F1: 0.96):** Excellent results, though support is very low (**29 samples**), raising concerns about generalizability.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ### Weak Performers:\n",
        "   - **Food Additives and Flavourings (F1: 0.35):** Perfect precision (**1.00**) but extremely poor recall (**0.21**), indicating very conservative predictions.\n",
        "   - **Organoleptic Aspects (F1: 0.38):** Similar to the above, precision is high but recall is very low.\n",
        "   - **Packaging Defect (F1: 0.39):** Poor recall (**0.26**) suggests difficulty identifying these cases.\n",
        "   - **Other Hazard (F1: 0.61):** Moderate performance with low recall (**0.46**).\n",
        "\n",
        "   ### Overfitting Indicators:\n",
        "   - **Precision-Recall Disparity:** The significant gap between **macro average precision (0.89)** and **macro average recall (0.62)** suggests potential overfitting. The model confidently predicts a few dominant classes but fails to generalize to minority classes.\n",
        "   - **Low Recall for Minority Classes:** For low-support categories like \"food additives and flavourings\" and \"organoleptic aspects,\" the model achieves perfect precision but nearly zero recall, indicating memorization rather than generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ### Model's Strengths and Weaknesses:\n",
        "   ### Strengths:\n",
        "   - Excellent performance on majority classes like allergens and biological hazards.\n",
        "   - High precision in predicting categories with substantial support.\n",

        "     2. **Focus on Evaluation Metrics:**\n",

        "     3. **Introduce Regularization:**\n",
        "   - Apply regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization to reduce overfitting.\n",
        "   - Monitor performance on a validation set to detect overfitting during training.\n",
        "    - Note: Regularization for example in Logistic Regression is represented with the parameter `C` in wich we want to have lo  numbers if we want regularization. \n",
        "      - If logistic regression verified as our best model at first glance compared to X-Boost (advanced algorythm) and Random Foresr (simpel algorythm) we will apply hyperparameter tuning emphasizing on this parameter possible values. \n",
