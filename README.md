### Applied Data Science Projects

This repository presents a curated collection of applied data science projects, demonstrating the practical use of machine learning, data analysis, and visualization techniques.

### Project Overview

- **Food Hazard Detection** – [Food](Food):  
  This project contains code developed for the [Food Hazard Detection Competition](https://food-hazard-detection-semeval-2025.github.io/). It focuses on leveraging natural language processing and machine learning methods to detect potential food-related hazards from textual data.

- **City Segmentation via Clustering** – [Clustering](Clustering):  
  This notebook explores the [GSV-Cities dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amaralibey/gsv-cities) from Kaggle. The objective is to apply unsupervised learning techniques, particularly clustering algorithms, to identify patterns and segment urban areas based on geospatial and visual data attributes.

- **Proverb Analysis** – [Proverb](proverb):  
  Developed within the scope of the **Practical Data Science** course, this project investigates proverbs using data-centric methods. It includes tasks such as annotation agreement analysis and visualization using Python libraries, aiming to uncover linguistic and cultural patterns embedded in proverbs.
